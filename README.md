# TypingChallenge
## This application gets a random sentence in improper Latin (Lorem ipsum). The user is tasked with typing that sentence. If the user types a correct character, the retrieved sentence charcter will turn green. If the user types an incorrect character, the retrieved sentence character will turn red. Once the sentence is typed correctly, all letters in the recieved sentence will be green, and the user will see "Success!". To retrieve another random sentence, the user will need to refresh the page. It's a fun little applicaion, but also practical as the user can improve thier typing skills.
